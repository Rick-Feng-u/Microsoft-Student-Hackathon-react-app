/**
 * A color value.
 *
 * Color values are expressed using various formats, some of which are
 * unique to a platform.
 *
 * As a general guideline, CSS color syntax should work on all platforms. See
 * https://reactnative.dev/docs/colors for more details.
 *
 * An example of a platform-specific color is a MacOS semantic color:
 *
 * `{semantic: "windowBackgroundColor"}`
